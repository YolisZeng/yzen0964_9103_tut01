# Hi How are you

This my project


# Imaging Technique Inspiration 1

My art project aims to explore dreamy and surreal visual aesthetics.

This artwork uses programming to reconstruct eight ancient artifacts, showing how broken relics come to life through the ripples of time from a digital art perspective. The fragmented particle effect is very inspiring, and I hope to apply this reconstruction technique in my final project.



This project explores the theme of electronic lichen. Its flowing, fragmented particle effect really attracts me, and I’d like to experiment with this technique in my future work.

I was inspired by the project’s layered visuals and floating mix of ruins and nature. I want to use its fragmented, immersive style to create a surreal space that blurs reality and imagination.

# Coding Technique Exploration 1

Pixel Swapper can help me create this kind of particle effect. This code uses the get() and set() functions in p5.js to randomly swap pixels in an image. By repeating this process, it creates a flowing, glitchy distortion effect that helps me achieve a dreamy and surreal visual style.

Random Walker can help me achieve the visual effect I want. I can set a specific color range and let the code change colors within that range.


This code creates a parallax effect by moving dots at different speeds based on the mouse position, helping me build a layered, dynamic, and immersive visual scene.
